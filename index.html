                    <b> Salaar is an upcoming Telugu movie</b> scheduled to be released on 28 Sep, 2023. The movie is
                    directed
                    by Prashanth Neel
                    and will feature Prabhas, Shruti Haasan, Prithviraj Sukumaran and Jagapathi Babu as lead characters.
                    Other popular
                    actors who were roped in for Salaar are Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand and Abhinay Raj Singh.
                    As of my last update in September 2023, "Salaar" is an upcoming Indian action thriller film directed
                    by Prashanth Neel.
                    Prashanth Neel is the same director who gained immense popularity with the blockbuster Kannada film
                    "KGF: Chapter 1". "Salaar"
                    is expected to be released in multiple languages, including Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, and
                    Malayalam.
                    The film stars popular South Indian actor Prabhas in the lead role. Prabhas is widely known for his
                    work
                    in the "Baahubali" series, which became a massive success worldwide. His involvement in "Salaar" has
                    generated
                    significant anticipation and excitement among his fans and the audience in general.
                    As for the plot of the movie, specific details were not widely available up until my last update.
                    However, considering
                    Prashanth Neel's penchant for crafting intense and action-packed narratives, "Salaar" is likely to
                    be a high-octane thriller with a compelling storyline.
                    Please note that since my knowledge is based on information available up until September 2023, there
                    might have been further developments or
                    changes regarding the film's release date, cast, or plot details. For the most up-to-date
                    information, I recommend checking official sources,
                    entertainment news websites, or social media platforms.
